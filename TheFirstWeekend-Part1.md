After months of chatting, we finally arranged our first meeting. We have the entire weekend to ourselves.

You have the hotel name and address, a room number, and guidance on what to wear.

You arrive at the hotel and nervously ask for your key at the front desk. They check your ID and then smile and tell you to enjoy your stay as they hand you the keycard. You check your watch as you ride up the elevator. 6:22. 

Good, a little more than half an hour before I arrive at 7 pm sharp.

You open the door to a very nice king suite on the 20th floor. You remember a previous conversation regarding activities on upper floor balconies and decide to check. Sure enough, it has a balcony. You smile quickly realizing that this may well be part of this weekend's escapades. You set your bags down and slip off your shoes.

### Preparation 

There is a sealed envelope on the bed with your name on it. You open it and find the promised instructions.

1. First, Relax for a bit. I know you had a busy day. Have a glass of wine, or 2. Your favorite Chardonnay should be chilled in the refrigerator.
2. Drink water. You grin because I'm always bugging you about drinking more water.
3. Next, you are to wear only heels and panties.
4. You will edge yourself with your fingers only for at least 10m, with no climax.
5. Put on nipple clamps.
6. Be kneeling on the floor with your mouth open at 6:55.
7. Your safe words as agreed are yellow & red.

You pour yourself a glass of wine and sit down for a moment. Grateful for a quiet minute to turn your mind from your day and prepare yourself for this evening. As you slowly undress you notice that you are a bit anxious and second-guessing yourself. 

What if this is awkward?
What if he isn't pleased with me?
What if he is just a creep? 

But you can't deny that your body is aching and your mind has been racing in anticipation all day. There is no way you are getting dressed and going home now. Your curiosity must be finally satisfied.

Sitting in the chair in your panties and one hand holding the wine you let your hand slip down inside your panties and begin to slowly touch yourself. You are momentarily surprised at how wet you are but remember that you've practically been wet all day. Per my request, you haven't had a climax in 4 days. You were permitted a few edges for the first 3 days but today as been no touching allowed until this moment. Your fingers follow your swollen lips and gently push against your throbbing clit. You breathe deeply and freeze so you don't accidentally go too far.

You check your watch. 6:51

You gulp down the remaining amount of wine and pour a second. You take the nipple clamps and attach them standing in front of the mirror. When each clamp closes on your sensitive nipples you feel the pain course through your body. You grimace and tell yourself to breathe.

You find the Fiji water bottle and take a few deep drinks to hydrate and a then few more large sips of wine. You check your phone, 6:56.

You put a pillow on the floor. You check your hair in the mirror one last time. You kneel on the floor.

At exactly 7 pm you hear the keycard and door latch. You catch your breath and freeze.

### Arrival 

I step inside the room. Turning around to lock the door. I set my bag down in the closet and step into the restroom to wash my hands. I step out of the bathroom still drying my hands. I walk slowly but purposefully to you. I pause and drink you in with my eyes. I smile proudly but say nothing.

I step closer. Laying the towel on the bed I then unzip my jeans. My thick hard cock springs out. I place the head of it on your lips. You keep your mouth open as instructed.

Then I lean into you a bit. Sliding the base of it across your tongue and deep into your mouth. I give you a moment to adjust and then push your head down to take it all.

“Mmmmmm good girl.”

I feel you choke a bit and hold you just a moment longer. Then release your head. I hear you gasp for air and see the first bit of saliva drip from your mouth.

I reach down and touch your amazing soft breasts. Slightly tweaking your nipple with the clamp. I take the chain into my hand.

"Again," I say. I use the chain to pull you forward onto my cock.

You devour my cock once again. You look up at me with your beautiful eyes and I begin to slightly tug on your chain. 

“What a wonderful slut you are. Did you edge as I instructed?”

You answer while my cock is still in your mouth. "Yes sir"

“Show me,” I reply.

You take your hand and nearly whimper as you slide your fingers into your hungry cunt. You get your hand soaking wet and hold it up for me to inspect.

I taste your fingers. Licking every drop our your delicious wetness.

I reach down, caressing your face. Then my hand slides behind your head. Using a firm hand in your hair I start to pull you to your feet.

I pause to look at you again. I stand in front of you and lean in to give you a deep passionate kiss while my hands are in your hair. I slowly turn you around while we kiss. Your back is now facing the bed.

I stop the kiss abruptly and smile.

I push you back onto the bed. I walk to the side of the bed and grab your arms, spinning you 90° and pulling you so that your head hangs off the side. 

I stand over you letting you kiss my cock and lick it. You feel me pull away slightly from your mouth and you open wide for me to fill you with my cock. I plunge deep into your mouth. Pushing against your throat. Again I hold still for a moment to enjoy the feeling of your wet and willing mouth. I pull out a bit to make sure you can breathe and then begin thrusting into your beautiful face. As I lean over you one hand is holding me up and is holding your chain so it's taught as your breasts bounce. The other hand finds your soaking swollen pussy. My fingers dive hungrily inside of you. Roughly fingering you and pressing up toward your g-spot. I can hear your moans mixed with your wet mouth being fucked. My fingers move to your clit  and begin to move quickly from side to side. The days of denial and the lust of the moment have you ready to explode.

I'm getting close and straighten up, pulling your nipples as I do and still furiously working your clit.

I hear you begin to yell and groan as you start to climax and it pushes me over the edge. I pump my thick load into your mouth as you gasp for air and your body is wrecked by the orgasm.

I pull out and turn you over. Your body still trembling with convulsions from the climax while you are coughing and drooling saliva and cum. I gently gather your hair and wipe your face with a towel. I reach over and release each nipple clamp. The pain of the blood rushing back in causes you to yelp. I gently run your breasts and nipples to help ease the pain. 

I kiss you tenderly. I smile at you.

"Hi hon, let me get a bath going for you."
